      <h1>About Highland Farm</h1>
      <p>Nestled in the heart of the Hudson Valley, Highland Farm has supplied the northeast with the finest all natural, farm-raised venison since 1989.<br><br>
Our deer are raised on pasture and fed locally grown hay and grain, which helps produce the delicate flavor and superb tenderness of our venison. Processed year-round in our own facility, under 2 years of age, we strive to ensure consistent flavor, texture, and taste in our venison. We use no steroids or growth hormones, and our meat is free of chemical additives.<br><br>
Our farm-raised venison is available year-round. You may order direct, or find our meats in various local restaurants and stores. You will also find us at the Rhinebeck and Kingston farmers' markets, and at many fairs and festivals throughout the Hudson Valley, including the annual Dutchess County Fair, and the ever-popular Sheep & Wool Festival in Rhinebeck, New York.</p>
